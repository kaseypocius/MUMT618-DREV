# MUMT618-DVERB

<h1> DVerb </h1>
A plate reverberator "in the style of Griesinger" as proposed by Jon Dattorro in his paper, Effect Design Part 1, implemented using the <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/">STK Library</a> . Very close to the plate algorithms found on the original <a href= "https://www.vintagedigital.com.au/lexicon-224-digital-reverberator/">Lexicon 224. </a>
