<h1> What is a plate reverb? </h1>
A plate reverb is the simulation of reverberation through the use of a physical plate, often made of gold. The source sound is played through the plate, where it is picked up by multiple piezo pickups placed throughout the plate. The plate can be damped by a secondary material, which is moved closer to the reverberator plate to reduce the reverb time and reduce the high frequency content. <br>
In digital algorithms, plate-style reverberation will often refer to any algorithm where there are little to no early reflections and the late reflections occur almost immediately. 

<h2> Why the Dattorro Algortihms? </h2>
The algortihms proposed are simple and effecient, and I had previous positive experience with other reverbs based upon modifications to these algorithms. As a result I believed this algorithm to be a good fit to try and implement in STK, and could prove to be useful in the future should I seek to experiment more with expanding it. 

<h4> Some other artistic inspirations worth mentioning</h4>
My personal experience of the following VSTs and hardware modules have heavily inspired the design here

<h6>Software</h6>
<a href="https://valleyaudio.github.io/rack/plateau/index.html"> Plateau </a>



<h6>Hardware</h6>
<a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Svm0Ku6cAY"> Shimmer Cartridge for Tiptop Audio Z-DSP </a> - the quad version of Shimmering Peaks is inspired by the Quad Mode on this version of the Valhalla shimmer algorithm  <br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/PS_aj2jZgyM?t=1215">Erica Synths Black Hole DSP 2</a> Another eurorack module with a shimmer implementation  <br>
<a href="https://mqtthiqs.github.io/parasites/clouds.html">Mutable Instruments Clouds - Parasite Firmware - Oliverb Mode</a> An alternative firmware for a eurorack digital granulator module, which adds a reverb mode capable of shimmer effects. I often use this in VCV Rack via <a href="https://github.com/adbrant/ArableInstruments"> this port. </a><br>
<a href="http://www.makenoisemusic.com/modules/erbe-verb">Make Noise Erbe Verbe </a> Tom Erbe's DSP Reverb for Make Noise, and the inspiration of the Oliverb Mode. Obviously an inspiration to this project as well.
