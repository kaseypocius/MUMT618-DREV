<h1> Tutorial </h1>
A tutorial on how to use my adaptation of the Dattorro Reverberator, with your defaul audio device.

1. Make sure you have the STK compiled for your machine, and that you know where the files are. For more help on that see <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/index.html"> the STK documentation </a>

2. Compile each program, either through included compile statements (<i>which assumes that the STK is located on your desktop</i>)

3. Run them from the command line with 12 arguments, or 14 if using the quad version. If operated incorrectly a usage statement will implement a default value instead. They are input as follows

```
t60
Base Peak Frequency
Peaks Spacing Constant
 
```

4. Press Enter when you're done. The software will cleanup and shutdown.
