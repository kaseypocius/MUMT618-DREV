<h1> Tutorial </h1>
A tutorial on how to use the Shimmering Peaks Reverbs, with your defaul audio device.

1. Make sure you have the STK compiled for your machine, and that you know where the files are. For more help on that see <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/index.html"> the STK documentation </a>

2. Compile each program, either through included compile statements (<i>which assumes that the STK is located on your desktop</i>)

3. Run them from the command line with 12 arguments, or 14 if using the quad version. If operated incorrectly a usage statement will implement a default value instead. They are input as follows

```
t60
Base Peak Frequency
Peaks Spacing Constant
Mod Frequency
Left Shift Factor
Right Shift Factor
Input Gain
Output Gain
Feedback
Pitch Shift Mix
Verb Mix
Peak Mix
Left Shift Factor 2
Right Shift Factor 2
```

4. Press Enter when you're done. The software will cleanup and shutdown.
